# i18n Constants for general use on the client side

# Many of these strings consist of overrides to be displayed instead of the common
# plural form for a corresponding plural form. These strings are generally blank, but may
# be overridden in locale-specific ClientConstants.properties files, even
# ClientConstants_en.properties.
# Strings that consist of _ indicate that there was a UI decision not to show a particular
# string in a particular context. This decision is enforced elsewhere in the code -- the
# mechanism doesn't _rely_ on seeing "_" as the value for these strings -- but locale-specific
# .properties should not generally override _ strings, and if they do, this will log
# warnings in development mode.

## Content types are handled in ClientMessages, but specific locales may selectively
## override some of these strings, if appropriate
